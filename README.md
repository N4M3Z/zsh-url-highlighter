zsh-url-highlighter
===================

A plugin for the zsh syntax highlighter that turns URLs green if they respond with a "good" status, and red otherwise. Useful for checking URL typos.

Very rough implementation at the moment - I began building this as a learning exercise.

Any help / pull requests / comments very welcome!
